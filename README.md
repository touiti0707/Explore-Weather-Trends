# Explore Weather Trends
In this project, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.
My goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. To do this, I follow the steps below:
* Extract the data from the database using SQL queries and exporting the data to CSV.
* Create a line chart that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures using Excel. I plot the 5-year moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable .
* Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.

My submission is a PDF that includes:
* The SQL queries used to extract the data.
* An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart.
* A line chart to visualize the data.
* Four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends.

# Files used
I used two datasets : 
* global.csv,
* local.csv
